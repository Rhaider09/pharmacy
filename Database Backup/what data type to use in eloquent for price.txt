The accepted datatype for money, according to GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) is Decimal (9, 4).... 
if you need bigger numbers then Decimal (13, 4)...

You should never use floats for money as they are stored in the database as approximations and 
if you multiply many times your results will not be accurate
